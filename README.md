# Project_Delta
Unnamed Top Down Space Shooter in its early stages.

The purpose of this project is to learn and improve with both C# and Unity. Currently this build is following the progress of a course with my own twists and changes.

My overall goal is to create an enviroment where people can learn and teach. If you find the project interesting, want to contribute or have questions you can reach me at this discord https://discord.gg/HuuBa83
